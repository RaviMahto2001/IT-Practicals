                <p>The BSc in Computer Science has immense scope in India. Computer education has always had a lot of
                    importance owing to the Country's IT industry. Therefore, a BSc in Computer Science degree has a
                    lot of value and will most likely lead to employment with a good salary and benefits. Computer
                    education in India is so important that people who do other degrees also do additional
                    computer-based certification courses to add value to their degree.</p>
